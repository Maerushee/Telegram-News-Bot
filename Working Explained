Polling - Waste of time and resources
 
so use Webhook :


	      	/start                Webhook (url)
          ----------------->       <-----------------
                                     MB said /start 
Maerushee                    Bot   ----------------->   Webhook Server Program
                                     Send HI to MB
  	 <-----------------       <-----------------
             Hi Maetrushee 

benefit :we dont have to poll , instread telegram bot tells the server (using call back request - url)


(1) We need to create a server program 
what is a server program ? --- a server is any kind of application or a program which keeps running
				infinitely in a way and if any request is received at any url at any 
				time .Then the server responds to it by creating a response .
 
Flask - it is a micro web framework . 
pip install flask

(2) Write some code 

(3) Public Url 
ngrok 
It is a free tool that allows us to tunnel from a public url to our application running locally 
  * Download ngrok
  * Unzip It
  * Run ngrok from command line (from the location where executable is stored )

'''ngrok http 8443'''
( for Windows )
